# LocalHelp

LocalHelp is a community-driven service marketplace designed to connect users with trusted local service providers. The platform serves as a single destination for discovering, booking, and managing essential day-to-day services offered by individuals within a local community.

## Overview

LocalHelp bridges the gap between people seeking help for everyday tasks and skilled individuals capable of providing those services. The platform focuses on simplicity, transparency, and accessibility, ensuring users can quickly find what they need without complexity.

## Core Concept

The platform enables two types of users:

1. **Customers**  
   Individuals looking for services such as tutoring, home cleaning, pet care, electrical repair, cooking assistance, and more.

2. **Service Providers**  
   Verified and skilled individuals who offer services within the community. Providers can register, build profiles, display pricing, and manage their offerings.

The platform ensures a smooth transition for customers who wish to become providers by allowing them to upgrade their role and submit additional details.

## Key Features

### User Authentication
Users can sign up, log in, and maintain authenticated sessions using secure JWT-based cookies. Role-based access ensures that protected routes are accessible only to the correct user type.

### Service Categories
The landing page displays a structured collection of service categories. Each category includes visually recognizable icons and leads to a list of available providers for that service.

### Provider Profiles
Service providers maintain detailed profiles that may include pricing, services offered, experience, and verification status. Customers can browse these profiles and choose providers based on their requirements.

### Location Detection
The platform can request permission to access the user's geographic location. Upon approval, it automatically detects and displays the user's city, allowing the service listings to be personalized based on location.

### User Dashboard
A dedicated dashboard allows authenticated users to browse categories, view metrics, and explore services with a clear and focused interface. Metrics highlight platform scale such as customer counts, verified providers, and service availability.

### Become a Provider
A streamlined onboarding process enables existing users to become service providers. This includes collecting additional information and setting up a provider profile.

## Vision

LocalHelp aims to empower local communities by encouraging skill-sharing and offering opportunities for small-scale service providers. At the same time, it provides customers with a reliable system to find capable individuals for everyday tasks. The goal is to simplify daily life through accessible, community-based solutions.
